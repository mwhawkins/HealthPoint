# HealthPoint
HealthPoint capstone project for computer science degree program. 

This project incorporates geographical (GIS) routing, geolocation services (for check-in/check-out of a location) and provides custom health input forms to collect patient data from clinicians out and about in the community. It also has the ability to review and edit prior data collected by location and/or patient. The application uses route optimization to identify best (shortest) routes for the mobile clinician to take for their planned patient visitations.

This was an academic project, so it has no ability currently to store protected data and was not intended for production use in its current state.

If you decide to use this codebase in your project, please refer to the license.
