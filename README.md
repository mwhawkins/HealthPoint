# HealthPoint
HealthPoint capstone project for computer science degree program. 

This project incorporates geographical (GIS) routing, geolocation services and provides custom health input forms to collect data from clinicians out and about in the community. It also has the ability to review prior data collected by location/patient. The application uses route optimization to identify best (shortest) routes for the clinician prior to starting their planned visitations.

This was an academic project, so it has no ability currently to store protected data and was not intended for production use in its current state.

If you decide to use this codebase in your project, please refer to the license.
