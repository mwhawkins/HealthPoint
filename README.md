# HealthPoint Plus (HPP)

HealthPoint Plus was a prototype capstone project for an undergraduate computer science program. This was made very rapidly over the course of just a couple weeks and really hasn't been updated since, so I decided to open-source it.

**Some features:**
* This project incorporates linear geographical (GIS) routing, HTML5 browser-based geolocation (for check-in/check-out at a location) and a geocoding API.
* It provides custom geo-tagged input forms to collect patient data from clinicians out and about in the community. 
* It also has the ability to review and edit prior data collected by location and/or patient. 
* It can save routes for future reference with authenticated protection from unauthorized editing/deletion. 
* The application uses route optimization to identify best (shortest) routes for the mobile clinician to take for their planned patient visitations.

This was an academic project, so it has no ability currently to store personally identifiable data (SSN's) and was not intended for production use in its current state.

If you decide to use this codebase or any part thereof in your own project, please refer to the license.
