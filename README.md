# HealthPoint

HealthPoint capstone project for undergraduate computer science program. 

This project incorporates geographical (GIS) routing, geolocation services (for check-in/check-out at a location) and provides custom health input forms to collect patient data from clinicians out and about in the community. It also has the ability to review and edit prior data collected by location and/or patient. The application uses route optimization to identify best (shortest) routes for the mobile clinician to take for their planned patient visitations.

This was an academic project, so it has no ability currently to store protected data and was not intended for production use in its current state. With some work, it may hold commercial promise.
