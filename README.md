# HealthPoint Plus (HPP)

HealthPoint Plus was a capstone project for an undergraduate computer science program. 

**Some features:**
* This project incorporates linear geographical (GIS) routing, geolocation services (for check-in/check-out at a location), a geocoding API.
* It provides custom geo-tagged input forms to collect patient data from clinicians out and about in the community. 
* It also has the ability to review and edit prior data collected by location and/or patient. 
* It can save routes for future reference with authenticated protection from unauthorized editing/deletion. 
* The application uses route optimization to identify best (shortest) routes for the mobile clinician to take for their planned patient visitations.

This was an academic project, so it has no ability currently to store personally identifiable data (SSN's) and was not intended for production use in its current state.
